    "name": "CycleGAN Rediscovery Study",
    "summary": "CycleGAN is a generative image model that stylizes images from one domain to another. In addition to the original paper's datasets, I perform webscraping to generate my own datasets, such as water/wine. I achieve comprable results to the original paper and success on a number of my own datasets. Finally, I analyze where and why the model fails.",
