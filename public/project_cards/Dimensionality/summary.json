    "name": "Spectral Clustering using Neural Dimensionality Reduction",
    "summary": "In this project, I compare 2 solutions to the \"Curse of Dimensionality\". Namely, I compare Autencoders - a popular ML compression method - with the traditional PCA (Data Science) algorithms. Performance is measured across multiple datasets and metrics and findings are summarized in the paper below.",
